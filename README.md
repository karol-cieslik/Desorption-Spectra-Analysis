In the project data is imported, cleaned and analyzed. The user can use this notebook to optimize analysis parameters for one data set and then use them for a batch import, cleaning and analysis of all their data.

# Plan of the notebook

1. Short introduction
2. Analysis of a single spectrum
    1. Import and basic filtering
    2. Separating the linear region of heating
    3. Filtering of the signal and plotting data
    4. Leading edge analysis (analysis of the first peak)
    5. Redhead analysis (analysis of the second peak)
3. Batch analysis
    1. Batch import
    2. Batch analysis
    3. Exporting the results
